# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
This analysis is using Rscript to perform Multi-Linear Analysis to solve the problem for MechaCar Manufacturing process.
## objective 1:Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. The P value of the linear regression is around 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than the 0.05% of the assumed level.
2. R sqtr is 0.7149 so 71% of the effectivity level for mpg predicting
3. Boundary of data like car length and ground clearance that need to be controlled with non random data in the production.

## objective 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
1. P=1
2. P=0.6 and these 2 tests are above the 5% and meeting the criteria.

## objective 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
A new design would be choosing different engines from Mechcar and its Competitor to re-do the statisital analysis.
The drive trim and the engine type could be the independent variables.
